# CubicPrimalityTest

WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

Test code to verify a cubic primality test, based on linear recurrences

The official paper describing the test and its proofs is work-in-progress

So far, no counterexample (pseudo prime) has been found. Exhaustives tests completed to 10^15


The test code implements a distributed architecture to spread the work over many cores of multiple computers.
Results are collected by the server.
